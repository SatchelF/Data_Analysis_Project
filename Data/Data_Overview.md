# Dataset Summaries for U.S. Gas Prices Analysis Project

## Understanding Gasoline Types and Formulations

### Regular, Midgrade, and Premium Gasoline
- **Regular Gasoline**: Most common, suitable for the majority of vehicles, with an octane level around 87 in the U.S.
- **Midgrade Gasoline**: Higher octane level than regular (around 89), designed for vehicles requiring more performance.
- **Premium Gasoline**: Highest octane level (91 or higher), for high-performance engines requiring the highest octane.

### Conventional vs. Reformulated Gasoline
- **Conventional Gasoline**: Meets basic federal requirements, used where air quality is not a significant issue, and may not contain oxygenates.
- **Reformulated Gasoline (RFG)**: Blended to reduce emissions, required in cities with significant smog problems, contains oxygenates for cleaner burning.
