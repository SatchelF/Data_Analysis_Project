## Project Description
This project aims to analyze U.S. gas price trends and their impacts on the economy. By examining gas price data across different states and regions, we will explore how prices respond to world events, seasonal changes, and state-specific laws. We will also investigate the relationship between gas prices and economic indicators such as inflation, aiming to provide insights that can inform business and economic strategies.

## Datasets
We will utilize the following datasets:
- **EIA's Detailed Gas and Diesel Reports**: Provides weekly average prices for various grades of gasoline and diesel across multiple U.S. regions since 1990.
- **Democrat and Chronicle Gas Price Dataset**: Offers a broader context for regional price variations.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Collect data from the [EIA's detailed gas and diesel reports](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/) and the [Crude Oil Prices - 70 Year Historical Chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart)
- **Cleaning**: Remove or correct anomalies such as missing values, duplicates, or incorrect data types.
- **Normalization**: Adjust prices for inflation where necessary to allow for accurate comparisons over time.
- **Transformation**: Reshape the dataset for analysis, including structuring it into a clean, analyzable format.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct EDA to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset. This includes analyzing gas price variations by season, region, and over time.

### Step 4: Statistical and Predictive Analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical tests to explore correlations between gas prices and economic indicators.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to predict future gas prices based on historical trends and other relevant factors.

### Step 5: Data Visualization
- Create visual representations of our findings to highlight key trends and insights.

### Step 6: Compilation of Findings
- Compile our analyses into a final report that includes data visualizations, interpretations of our statistical analyses, and recommendations based on our findings.
